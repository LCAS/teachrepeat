# Multi-Modal Teach & Repeat  

## Overview  

This package is part of the navigation stack developed for IUK Agri-OpenCore. It provides an enhanced teach-and-repeat module for robotic navigation using a multi-modal approach. RGB-D and laser data are recorded during the teaching phase and compared with real-time data to adjust the robot's alignment during the repeat phase.
